# üåø leaFIT: AI Smart Plant Watering System

leaFIT is a senior project developed to automate plant maintenance using embedded systems and machine learning. It integrates real-time sensor data, AI camera recognition, and wireless communication to support plant care with minimal user intervention.

## üöÄ Features

- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Utilizes soil moisture, light, and temperature sensors to collect live data for dynamic plant care decisions.
- **AI Camera Mode**: Implements image-based analysis using an ESP32-CAM to assess plant conditions.
- **LoRa-Based Wireless Communication**: Ensures long-range, low-power data transfer between sensor nodes and the base station.
- **MQTT Protocol & Adafruit IO**: Enables cloud connectivity for data transmission and remote plant control.
- **Embedded System Design**: Custom hardware schematic for reliable power management and communication.
- **Data Visualization**: Sensor and camera data displayed through a cloud dashboard interface.
- **Low Maintenance**: Designed to reduce human intervention with an autonomous watering mechanism triggered by real-time data.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technologies Used

- **Microcontroller**: ESP32, ESP32-CAM
- **Communication**: LoRa, UART, MQTT
- **Cloud**: Adafruit IO
- **Languages**: Embedded C, Python
- **Other Tools**: UART debugging, BOM documentation
